# User-Story Descriptions

## User Story #1 - The New Hire
Thomas is a new hire in Company X1A, a software development company that focuses on managing and creating an app about managing flowers. Thomas is anxious as the company has managed to create a number 1 app on the app store, he is unsure of how he can even get along with successful people. During the onboarding that he did for the company he was sent a link to join the chatroom filled with every other employee. Unsure of how to react he didn’t say anything. Then the VibeCheck Chatbot noticed his arrival, and initiated an onboarding Vibe Check! “What kind of flowers do you like?” After responding to the chatbot, the VibeCheck Chatbot then prompted everyone in the groupchat to respond to Thomas's message, doing so will give the ones who did bonus points for the day. 

## User Story #2 - The Introverted Employee
Samantha is an introverted person working at Company X2B, a tech company that makes a specific brand of laptop, headphones, and tablets. She doesn’t interact with many other employees and mostly just keeps to herself. One day she gets an email inviting her to a chatroom as a part of new company policy. She hadn’t joined the chatroom for months, before getting reminded about it via an additional email. Once in she doesn’t receive the onboarding VibeCheck as she isn’t marked as a new employee. During her lunch break the next day she gets a VibeCheck! “What’s the vibes with your meal!” She watches as other employees post pictures of their lunch, and mark their own photos claiming it is a “Good Vibe Lunch”. Samantha posts her lunch and rates her having a “good vibe lunch”, many of her coworkers comment on her lunch, leading to her disclosing how she cooked her meals. The following day, VibeChecked prompted people to disclose their favorite home-cooked meals.
