# System Overview

## Abstract
**VibeCheck** is a cross-platform BeReal-inspired chatbot that integrates with Slack at the current moment

All user interactions are isolated to their respective chat environments. Can be implemented in communities or work-circles quietly.

## Goal
The primary goal of VibeCheck is to encourage social interaction through quicktime events similar to BeReal.
At random or scheduled intervals, users are given multiple prompts to respond to.

**Example interaction:**

> **Bot:**  
> @Khai — Post what you ate earlier  
> @Chris — Post what you are doing right now  
> You have 2 minutes to post
>
> **Khai:** *(uploads image of spaghetti and meatballs)*  
> **Chris:** *(uploads image of themselves running)*

These quicktime events create spontaneous and authentic moments of interaction.

## Scope
The scope of this project is to strengthen social connections within groupchats wheter they are workplace or between groupchats.

The BeReal Chatbot aims to bridge this gap by:
- Encouraging participation from members/employees
- Create natural conversations between new and existing members
- Decrease intimidation with new employees

Hopefully a timelimit of when people would have to type would encourage people to message.
