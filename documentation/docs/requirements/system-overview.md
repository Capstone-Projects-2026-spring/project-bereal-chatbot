# System Overview

## Abstract
**VibeCheck** is a cross-platform BeReal-inspired chatbot that integrates with multiple chat clients such as Discord, Slack, and SMS.

Rather than a traditional public social media platform, the chatbot creates a private, contained social experience within existing chatrooms or servers such as Discord.

All user interactions are isolated to their respective chat environments. Can be implemented in communities or work-circles quietly.

## Goal
The primary goal of VibeCheck is to encourage social interaction through **time-limited prompts**.  
At random or scheduled intervals, users are given a shared context and a short window of time to respond.

**Example interaction:**

> **Bot:**  
> @user1 — Post what you ate earlier  
> @user2 — Post what you are doing right now  
> You have 2 minutes to post
>
> **User1:** *(uploads image of spaghetti and meatballs)*  
> **User2:** *(uploads image of themselves running)*

These quick-time events create spontaneous and authentic moments of interaction.

## Scope
The scope of this project is to strengthen social connections within teams, communities, or workspaces—especially those consisting of both new and existing members.

Feedback has shown that newer members often feel intimidated joining conversations within tight-knit groups that already share inside jokes and established friendships. This social barrier can limit engagement and collaboration.

The BeReal Chatbot aims to bridge this gap by:
- Encouraging participation from members/employees
- Create natural conversations between new and existing members
- Decrease intimidation with new employees

By responding to the same prompt at the same time, users are given an easy and low-pressure way to connect.
