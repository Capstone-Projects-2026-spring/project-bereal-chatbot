# System Overview

# Abstract
---
The BeReal Chatbot is a crossplatform chatbot between different types of chat clients (Discord, Slack, SMS, etc...). The program will be a social media platform built into a bot implemented in chatroom clients. Instead of being a social media that is accessible to everyone, all interaction will be isolated within these chatroom/servers.

# Goal
---
The goal of the BeReal Chatbot is to provide users a way to interact socially through quicktime events of giving users a context and having them post to the corresponding context.
For an example:
\nBot: "@user1 post what you ate earlier"
    "@user2 post what you are doing right now"
    "You have 2 minutes to post"
User1: [post image of spaghetti and meatballs]
User2: [posts image of them running]
