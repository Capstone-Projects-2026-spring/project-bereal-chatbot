## Description

 This project is a BeReal ChatBot that operates within Slack to connect people in a professional or academic environment. This project will be comprised of Python, the Slack API, and a database.
 
 Users interact with the chatbot through a Slack group chat, which sends prompts to engage users. Users can respond to prompts by submitting messages or images. These interactions are received by the chatbot from Slack, handling data manipulation, sending responses back to users or the group chat, and storing data in the database.
